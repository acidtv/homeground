+ Load nodes from $radius outside of bounds

 * So polygons on the edge of the screen aren't hidden until you move

+ Clean up output polygons.

 * smooth outline to remove weird glitches

+ Being able to select 'forest' or 'park'

 * Calculations would have to happen based on a polygon instead of a point
 * Make a seperate flow for this use-case?
 * How to store these polygons? In nodes, or a new table?
